DroidQuest
==========

A Java recreation of the classic game Robot Odyssey I

Build with:

    mvn install

Run the game:

    MacOSX / Linux: ./start.sh
    Windows: start.bat (IN PROGRESS)
OR
    java -jar target/dq-1.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

Controls:

    / - contextual help
    arrows - normal movement
    control + arrows - fine-grained movement [OS X: command + arrows]
    space - pickup/drop
    C - game cursor
    H - hot cursor
    S - solder pen
    R - toggle radio
    P - paintbrush
    T - toolbox
    [, ] - rotate device
    F - flip
    L - load small chip
    E - enter robot
    X - exit robot

    Cheat/debug:

    shift + arrows - move rooms
    M - dump memory usage

Note: On OS X, control + arrow-keys are bound to Apple's "Mission Control".  I switched to the 'shortcut' modifier which is control on windows and command on OS X.  Alternatively, you can disable
built in OS X shortcuts via System Preferences -> Keyboard -> Shorcuts.

Note: Cheating (just teleporting between rooms ATM) may be enabled by passing "debug" on the command line. Currently the message about this doesn't work.
